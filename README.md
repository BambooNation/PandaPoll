# PandaPoll
We have prepared a cool web part to showcase the power of SP Framework. In few short weeks we were able to take an idea and turn it into a simple but useful web part for SharePoint sites. The fact that we were totally new to TypeScript, React, Gulp, Yeoman etc. and yet our team was able to pull off this web part in a very short time speaks to the strength of this framework.

The Panda Poll is a simple web part that allow's user to post a question in the form of a poll to the site reader and show the result as pie chart. Whether you want to collect trending thoughts or a quick feedback. This web part help breath some life to your SharePoint page.
